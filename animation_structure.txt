animation_info:
	1st byte - loop animation flag
	2nd byte - max frame number (number of frames - 1)

The rest of the bytes are frame numbers and frame times for each animation frame.
The frame number comes first and the frame time comes second.
	
frame_info:
	1st byte - mirrored in chrrom flag
            (in the current game engine,
            all characters drawn facing right
            in chrrom are considered to be non-mirrored,
            and characters facing left are mirrored) 
	2nd byte - center of frame in pixels
	3rd byte - number of sprites

The 2nd byte tells how many pixels to shift the origin point in order
to properly draw a mirrored version (since if you just mirrored it from
the origin at it's regular (0,0) coordinate, you'd shift the position of the
frame as well. With this value, you can ensure it's flipped from the middle.)

After the 3rd byte is the sprite info for each sprite in the frame.
The sprite info is arranged such that it is a certain offset
away from an origin point (0,0). X and Y offset bytes are signed, so they
can be negative.  These offsets are added in the game, unless there is horizontal mirroring,
in which case they are subtracted and the 2nd byte is added to the origin's x coordinate in
order to ensure mirroring occurs in the center (see above)

sprite_info:
	1st byte - Y coordinate offset from origin (signed)
	2nd byte - tile number
	3rd byte - attributes
	4th byte - X coordinate offset from origin (signed)
