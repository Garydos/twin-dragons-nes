text2vol5, replaces text2data
nsf2data5, replaces nsf2data
Doug Fraker, ver 5.1 6-22-2019, unofficial update, nesdoug.com


additions so far:
	-volume column support
	-full note range
	-1xx,2xx,3xx,4xx,Qxx,Rxx effects
	-duty cycle envelopes
	-sound fx > 256 bytes
	
version5.0:
	-added command line switch -allin to prevent removing unused instruments
	-added command line switch -Wno to ignore warnings about unsupported effects
	-fixed bug, multiple D00 effects (different channels) incorrect pattern length
	-fixed bug, Bxx below D00 effect (different channels) incorrect pattern length
	-fixed bug, Bxx loop back causing wrong instrument inserted at loop point
example of new switches:
text2vol4 filename.txt -ca65 -allin -Wno	

usage notes:
	-use nsf2data5 (included) for sound effects.
	-must use with famitone5 asm files
	-should use with famitracker 0.4.6 (or later) text export
	-use volume column for Square 1, Square 2, and Noise Channels
	-at the start of a song, the volume column is assumed to be 'f'
	-if you loop backwards, use a volume column entry for the first note at the 
	 loop point, or else it will carry over whatever volume is still loaded
	Example - at the start of the loop, you fail to put a volume column entry, 
	 but at the end of the loop, you fade out to zero. When it loops backwards, 
	the volume will still be set to zero.
	-use any note for Square 1 + 2, Triangle, or Noise Channel
	-restrict DPCM to C-1 to D-6
	-pal support has been removed. only the ntsc note table remains.


added features:
	-use the command line -allin to ensure all instruments are output, even if 
	 no song uses it. this may come in handy if you have too many songs and need 
	 to split the famitracker file into 2 parts.
	-the song titles will appear in comments in the asm data. This may come in 
	 handy if you need to cut or move 1 song for space reasons.

Support for 1xx,2xx,3xx,4xx,Qxx,Rxx effects. They apply to the Square and Triangle 
channels. Use 100,200,or 300 to disable the pitch bend. Use 400 to disable to vibrato. 
The vibrato speed (4xy where x is speed) is permanently set to 6. I recommend that you 
write all the vibrato effects like 461 462 463, etc. "a" (like 46a) is the maximum depth.

	Don't mix 1xx,2xx,3xx,Qxx,Rxx effects with arpeggio or pitch envelopes.

You can put a 1xx(2xx) and 4xx effect at the same time on a note, but not on the same 
line...only 1 fx column is allowed(per channel), so 1xx(2xx) on the first line and 4xx 
on the line below that.

	There is no range check for Qxx or Rxx effects. The code assumes that you, the 
musician, would not tell it to bend up to a note that doesn't exist.

	At line 318, I added 2 lines that should increase the volume of the triangle
channel (if you don't use DPCM samples). If this is too loud, edit the LDA as the
comments suggest.
