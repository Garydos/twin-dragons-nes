Programmer humility

I ran about 50 tests on this and I found bugs. All the different combinations of
1,2,3,4,Q,R effects were difficult to account for. I wrote some last minute bug 
fixes that are ugly/clunky. It seems to run smoothly now, but the code could use 
some rewriting, both for efficiency and size, but also for clarity. This will 
probably take me quite a while, if at all, due to my busy schedule.
 
It does pass all my tests, so I consider it finished enough for release.

But, it probably has bugs.
